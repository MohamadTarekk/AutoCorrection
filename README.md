# TextSuggestion

This repo is a mini-project for **Data Structures** course at _"Faculty of Engineering, Alexandria University"_.

It uses both **binary search trees** & **AVL trees** to store a dictionary. The user inputs a sentence and gets suggested corrections using  both of the trees. Suggestions differ depending on the used tree due to the balancing technique of the AVL tree.
